			"description": "Shenma reads this number of lines when the model omits start/end values. If this number is less than the file's total, Shenma generates a line number index of code definitions. Special cases: -1 instructs Shenma to read the entire file (without indexing), and 0 instructs it to read no lines and provides line indexes only for minimal context. Lower values minimize initial context usage, enabling precise subsequent line-range reads. Explicit start/end requests are not limited by this setting."
